I just finished reading over the entire project description to understand what the expectations are. I definitely think that it's very involved in terms of making sure that everything is synchronized. Clearly, the safe and the manager are shared resources so they will need to utilize semaphores, but I am not sure if there is anything else that needs to be protected. Also, it needs to be possible for any of the customer threads to communicate with any of the tellers because it just depends on who is free at the right time. I also need to have a global track of how many customers have been serviced so that the bank can close at the appropriate time. Right now, I don't really have a sense of how I'll scale it but I think I'm only going to start off with one customer and one teller and see if I can figure out the interactions between them. From there, I think I will be able to figure out how to implement the safe and the manager. I just think that I'll be overlooking a lot of the small details right now but I want to get started by creating classes for a Teller and Customer and just having the Customer tell the Teller what action they want to perform.

Okay, I started out by making two classes - one for Teller and one for Customer. I just worked on being able to initialize them with IDs, and then also once the Teller starts, it will print out that it is ready. I think that I will also include a flag so that customers are notified that there is a Teller ready to help them. I need global variables to keep track of which customers are waiting for a teller and then also to keep track of who has been served so that I can stop when that list reaches a certain size. Also, I will just have customers make a random choice of what type of transaction they are doing and then I'll add them to the waiting list. After that, I'll see if I can alert the tellers that there is a waiting customer - maybe I can do this based on a Thread event?

I ended up using the threading.Condition() module to communicate between the Customer and Teller. Basically, with the condition I add Customers to a global list of 'waiting' and this should notify the Teller to serve the customer. However, I can tell that the Customer is being added to the waiting list but I don't know why it's not waking up the Teller and the program just terminates somewhere in the middle and it freezes so I need to figure out why it's doing that.
