I just finished reading over the entire project description to understand what the expectations are. I definitely think that it's very involved in terms of making sure that everything is synchronized. Clearly, the safe and the manager are shared resources so they will need to utilize semaphores, but I am not sure if there is anything else that needs to be protected. Also, it needs to be possible for any of the customer threads to communicate with any of the tellers because it just depends on who is free at the right time. I also need to have a global track of how many customers have been serviced so that the bank can close at the appropriate time. Right now, I don't really have a sense of how I'll scale it but I think I'm only going to start off with one customer and one teller and see if I can figure out the interactions between them. From there, I think I will be able to figure out how to implement the safe and the manager. I just think that I'll be overlooking a lot of the small details right now but I want to get started by creating functions for a Teller and Customer and just having the Customer tell the Teller what action they want to perform.
